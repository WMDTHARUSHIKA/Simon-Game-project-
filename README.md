🎮 Super excited to have completed my very first Simon Game project, a fun and challenging web development journey! 💻🎨

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a splash of creativity, I built an interactive memory game that tests focus and reflexes. It was a great experience to practice coding skills and dive deeper into event handling, animations, and game logic. Can't wait to build even more exciting projects ahead! 🚀🕹
